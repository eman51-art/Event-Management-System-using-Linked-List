# 📅 Event Manager

A **console-based Event Manager application** developed in **C++** using a **Singly Linked List**.  
This project demonstrates how core **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** concepts can be applied to a real-life use case like managing events.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Add events with **name and date**
- 🗑️ Delete events by position
- ✏️ Update existing event names
- 📄 View all events
- 🔍 Search events by name
- 📆 Search events by date
- ✅ Date validation using **Regular Expressions**
- 🧠 Custom implementation of **Singly Linked List** (no STL containers)

---

## 🧱 Data Structure Used

### Singly Linked List

Each node contains:
- `eventName` – name of the event  
- `eventDate` – date of the event (YYYY-MM-DD)  
- `next` – pointer to the next node  

This structure helps in understanding dynamic memory allocation and pointer-based data handling.
